We are trying to understand
The teacher teaches in the classroom
Everything is perfect
Dogs are Man's best friend
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
When zombies arrive, quickly fax Judge Pat
Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes
Puzzled women bequeath jerks very exotic gifts
Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz
Five or six big jet planes zoomed quickly by the tower
A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz
Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud
My girl wove six dozen plaid jackets before she quit
Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
A wizardâ€™s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog
Brown jars prevented the mixture from freezing too quickly
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump
Waxy and quivering, jocks fumble the pizza
Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf
We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz
